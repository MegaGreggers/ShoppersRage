	- get all the items on your list in the cart and get them to the checkout as fast as possible.
	- bumping into too many NPCs will increase your anger meter and you'll lose your temper
		- this causes you to speed forward smashing through anything in your way, which COULD help, but will likely cause you to crash and knock all the groceries out of your cart
